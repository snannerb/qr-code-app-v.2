**User requests:**
build a qr code scavenger hunt based game . use only .html , .css, and .js
use geolocation-based qr code activation
geofencing logic (100m radius check)
qr code display (only if in range)
qr code scanner (scans and validates qr codes)
allow for the scavenger hunt creater to have full control over where the qr codes are located for individual games.
allow for a qr code scan that activates the start of the game.
allow for game creater to generate qr code that allows people to join that game.
allow for game creater to have a page full of clues .
allow the option of multiple scans needed to complete the game .
allow for a current progress scoreboard to be displayed of current players in a game.

### Project Plan: QR Code Scavenger Hunt Game

#### **Project Goals**
1. Develop a web-based QR code scavenger hunt game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2. Implement geolocation-based QR code activation, scanning, and validation.
3. Provide interfaces for game creators and players.
4. Enable real-time progress tracking and scoreboard updates.

### **Main Tasks**

#### **1. Setup and File Structure**
- Create the project directory and file structure.
- Set up basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
  - `index.html`: Landing page.
  - `creator.html`: Game creator dashboard.
  - `player.html`: Player interface.
  - `styles.css`: Global styles.
  - `creator.js`: Game creator logic.
  - `player.js`: Player logic.
  - `shared.js`: Shared functions (e.g., geofencing).

#### **2. Game Creator Dashboard**
- **Task 2.1: Input QR Code Locations**
  - Create a form for the game creator to input latitude and longitude for each QR code location.
  - **Technical Consideration**: Validate coordinates and store them in an array or object.
- **Task 2.2: Generate Join Game QR Code**
  - Use a QR code generation library (e.g., `qr-code-styling`) to create a unique QR code for joining the game.
  - **Technical Consideration**: Encode game-specific data (e.g., game ID) in the QR code.
- **Task 2.3: Manage Clues**
  - Provide a text area for the game creator to input and manage clues.
  - **Technical Consideration**: Store clues in an array or object for dynamic rendering.

#### **3. Player Interface**
- **Task 3.1: Geolocation-Based QR Code Activation**
  - Use the `navigator.geolocation` API to track the player’s location.
  - Implement geofencing logic to check if the player is within a 100-meter radius of a QR code location.
  - **Technical Consideration**: Calculate distances using the Haversine formula.
- **Task 3.2: QR Code Scanner**
  - Integrate a QR code scanner using a library like `jsQR` or `zxing`.
  - Validate scanned QR codes against predefined game codes.
  - **Technical Consideration**: Handle errors for invalid or unscannable QR codes.
- **Task 3.3: Progress Tracking**
  - Track the number of QR codes scanned by the player.
  - Display a progress scoreboard for all players in the game.
  - **Technical Consideration**: Use WebSocket or polling for real-time updates.

#### **4. Shared Features**
- **Task 4.1: Geofencing Logic**
  - Develop a shared function to check if a player is within the 100-meter radius of a QR code location.
  - **Technical Consideration**: Optimize calculations for performance.
- **Task 4.2: QR Code Generation**
  - Create a shared function to generate QR codes dynamically.
  - **Technical Consideration**: Ensure QR codes are scannable on all devices.

### **Technical Considerations**

1. **Geolocation API**
   - Use `navigator.geolocation.watchPosition` for continuous tracking.
   - Handle errors for denied permissions or unsupported devices.

2. **Geofencing**
   - Use the Haversine formula to calculate distances between two GPS coordinates.
   - Regularly update the player’s location and check against QR code locations.

3. **QR Code Libraries**
   - Use `qr-code-styling` for generating QR codes.
   - Use `jsQR` or `zxing` for scanning QR codes.

4. **Scoreboard Updates**
   - Use WebSocket or periodic polling to update the scoreboard in real-time.
   - Store player progress on the server or in local storage.

5. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**
   - Test the app on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
   - Use polyfills or fallbacks for unsupported features.

6. **Responsive Design**
   - Ensure the app is mobile-friendly and works on various screen sizes.
   - Use CSS media queries for responsive layouts.

### **Timeline**

#### Week 1: Setup and Basic Features
- Set up the project structure.
- Implement the game creator dashboard (Tasks 2.1, 2.2, 2.3).
- Implement the player interface (Task 3.1).

#### Week 2: Geolocation and QR Code Handling
- Implement geofencing logic (Task 4.1).
- Add QR code scanning and validation (Task 3.2).
- Generate and display QR codes dynamically (Task 4.2).

#### Week 3: Progress Tracking and Scoreboard
- Implement progress tracking (Task 3.3).
- Add a real-time scoreboard for players.

#### Week 4: Testing and Optimization
- Test the app for cross-browser compatibility and responsiveness.
- Optimize geofencing and QR code scanning performance.
- Debug and fix any issues.

2. Player Interface with QR code scanning and progress tracking.
3. Real-time progress scoreboard for players.
4. Fully functional geolocation-based QR code scavenger hunt game.
